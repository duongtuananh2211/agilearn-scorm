# Project Instructions

- This project uses **shadcn** as the UI library. All UI components should follow shadcn conventions and use its primitives where possible.
- **shadcn Component Usage Rules:**
  1. Prefer shadcn UI components as the default choice for building UI elements.
  2. To add a shadcn component, use:
     ```sh
     npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>
     ```
     Replace `<component>` with the desired component name (e.g., avatar, button, card).
  3. Place all shadcn components inside the `src/components/ui` directory.
  4. Customize components using Tailwind CSS utility classes only. Avoid raw CSS unless absolutely necessary.
  5. Do not use other UI libraries or CSS frameworks unless explicitly required.
  6. Ensure all components are responsive and accessible, leveraging Tailwind and shadcn features.
- This project uses **Firebase services**. Integrate and utilize Firebase for authentication, database, and other backend needs as required.
- All custom hooks must be placed inside the `/src/hooks` folder.
- All custom providers must be placed inside the `/src/providers` folder.
- All custom components must be placed inside the `components` folder.
- This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. All custom styles should use Tailwind utility classes where possible, and avoid writing raw CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use other CSS frameworks or libraries for styling unless explicitly required.
- When creating new components or pages, ensure they are responsive and accessible, leveraging Tailwind's features.
